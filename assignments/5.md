Lab Assignment 5: Working with SQLAlchemy ORM
=============================================

In this assignment we will do work similar to the previous assignment, but we will instead use the ORM system in SQLAlchemy where possible. Unlike assignment 4, in this assignment you will only work in Python. The relevant script is going to be [this](https://github.com/skiadas/DataWranglingCourse/blob/gh-pages/assignments/assignment5.py).

Recall that our database has three tables:

- `ev_users` contains personal user information, such as a user's username, first and last name, and their affiliation or role.
- `ev_events` contains events. An event has an id, a title, some location information, start and end times/days, and an owner's username.
- `ev_invites` manages invites of users to events. Each row contains an event id, a user's username, and also an entry that represents the status of the "invitation".

We now need to think of this in terms of classes. You will create three classes, all inheriting from `Base`: `User`, `Event`, and `Invite`.

It is important that you add these classes in the designated section of the code, and not at the end. They must precede the `metadata.drop_all(engine)` and `metadata.create_all(engine)` lines.

1. Create a class `User`. It should have fields `username`, `first`, `last`, `affiliation` as in assignment 4.
2. Create a class `Event`. It should have fields `id`, `title`, `longtitude`, `latitude`, `owner_name` (in place of `owner`), `start` and `end` as described in assignment 4.
3. Add a bidirectional relationship between Events and their Owners. To do that you will need to add a relationship `owner` in the `Event` class, which points to the `User` class, and a relationship `eventsOwned` in the `User` class, which points to the `Event` class, and to include `back_populates=...` entries to both to indicate how they relate to each other.
4. Create a class `Invite`. It should have fields `event_id`, `username`, `status` as in assignment 4.
5. Create bidirectional relationships between `User` and `Invite` (calling the two ends `invites` and `user` respectively) and `Event` and `Invite` (calling the two ends `invites` and `event` respectively). Don't forget to include `back_populates=...` entries to link the two together.
6. Create `User` objects representing yourself and one professor as described in part 4 of assignment 4. Then add the two objects to the session.
7. Use a list comprehension to create 100 `User` objects whose usernames are `"studentx"`, first names are `"Numberx"`, last name is `"Student"`, where `x` should be replaced by the incrementing numbers 1 up to 100. They all should have affiliation `"Hanover College, Student"`. Use the session's `add_all` method to add all these to the session. Keep the list stored in some variable, as you will need to do more work to it.
8. Create an event `"Homecoming get-together"` as described in assignment 4 and add it to the session.
9. Use a list comprehension to create `Invite` objects to this event you created, for each of the 100 students you created. Add them to the session.
10. Use the [`random.choices` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices) of the `random` module to create a list of 100 status values chosen at random from the three options `Status.Accepted`, `Status.Declined`, `Status.Maybe`, assigning weights so that Accepted has a 30% chance of being chosen, Declined has a 30% chance also, and Maybe has the remaining 40% chance. The `random` package has been imported for you already.

    Then use a suitable loop to assign these to the corresponding invite objects you created in the previous part. You MUST use the `zip` function of python to create a list of pairs of an invite and a choice, then do a `for` loop over this list. so your answer should end up looking like:

    ```python
    pairs = zip(..., ...)
    for invite, status in pairs:
        ... change the invite's status setting to provided value
    ```
11. You should be able to access the list of all invites to your event by doing something like `ev.invites`. Use a list comprehension starting from this list, to produce a list of strings, one for each invite with Accepted status, containing the first and last names of the invitee separated by a space. So your code might look something like:

    ```python
    accepted = [
        ... something with invite.user ...
        for invite in homecoming.invites
        .....
    ]
    print(accepted)
    ```
